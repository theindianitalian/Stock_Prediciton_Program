# Stock_Prediciton_Program

This program will allow the user to predict whether a company's stock of their choice will increase or decrease in the future.
They can use the machine learning technique of their choice: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, or a Neural Network.
They can also test the model after a technique is built. In addition, they can create a line graph of
a company's historical data of stock change in price over time by a start and end date of their choice.
